## About the project
---
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that emerged in late 2019 has caused almost 6 million deaths worldwide as of the time of writing this report. ([World Health Organization, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---1-march-2022)) This has made it the 5th deadliest pandemic worldwide. ([McKeever, 2021](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/covid-19-is-now-the-deadliest-pandemic-in-us-history)) Therefore, it has been the focus of scientists and researchers ever since, as its containment is a high priority worldwide. A number of previous studies ([McClymont, H., & Hu, W., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020396)) suggest that weather is a factor in COVID-19 transmission, particularly temperature and humidity.

We investigated the number of corona cases and some weather aspects in Sweden on regional and country levels. In addition, we performed the same analysis on Germany to verify results in Sweden, given that weather should have the same effect on the virus, regardless of the country. We also investigated the correlation between strigency levels and covid cases in both countries.

## Required Libraries
---
Numerous built-in and external Python libraries are used in this notebook. Thus, the notebook can run correctly only with all imported libraries installed.

In addition, the notebook should be made `Trusted` in order to correctly load all the maps.
